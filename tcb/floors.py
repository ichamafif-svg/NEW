"""The floors: what Standard imposes on every client, shipped with the release and covered by the code digest.

FLOOR-0 (floor0.py) guards the TCB itself. The floors carry the direction (autonomy, security, compliance) in the
same language as a client law, so that every requirement can produce a measurable gap: autonomy is the distance
between what the floors and the client require and what the repository has.

Only the Standard team changes this file, by a release. A client law never redefines, removes or weakens anything
declared here: it binds the floor roles to its own identities, adds its own declarations, and may only tighten.
Context-dependent requirements apply to every client through conditions on attested facts, never by opting out.

Two families of measures. Technical measures are observed by the independent scanner and repaired through
`remediate`: main moves from one exact commit (base) to one exact child commit (head), fast-forward, so the object of
the effect is the commit that was judged. Organisational measures are attested by the compliance officer, a human,
and have no automatic repair: their gap goes to people. Which ISO 27001, NIS2 and DORA control each measure evidences
is a projection outside the TCB (compliance/catalog.json).

Autonomy is reproducibility: a repair merges without a human only if an independent instrument recomputed exactly its
content from the base and trusted data (`reproduced`). Facts produced by running the commit's own code (`tests`) are
necessary signals, never sufficient grounds, since that code can lie about itself."""
